    "jobotIntroStage3b": "Today we will take a deeper look at the pollination process of plants.",
    "jobotIntroStage3c": "But what is pollination I hear you ask?",
    "jobotIntroStage3d": "Pollination is the process by which pollen is transferred from the stamen of a plant to the stigma of another plant of the same type.",
    "jobotIntroStage3e": "It is important to know that pollination is absolutely necessary in order for a plant to reproduce.",
    "jobotIntroStage3f": "Don't worry if this sounds confusing. We will get a hand on approach to this concept in today's tests.",

    "jobotStage3PlantWaterAssesmentText2": "Click a letter to choose it. Be careful, there are only 3 leaves on the branch, and every wrong guess removes a leaf. If all the leaves fall, you will need to try again on another plant.",

    "jobotStage3Butterfly1f": "Daisy pollen must be transferred to the stigma of another daisy for example.",
    "jobotStage3Butterfly1fa": "I found this old image in storage. I Hope It helps explain the stigma and stamen locations better.",
    "jobotStage3Butterfly1g": "If the pollen of a daisy is transferred to the stigma of a plant of a different species, pollination won't take place.",
    "jobotStage3Butterfly1h": "I have highlighted the stigma and stamen of your plants with arrows the same color as each flower's pollen.",
    "jobotStage3Butterfly1i": "You can see the color of pollen that each plant needs on the side of the screen.",
